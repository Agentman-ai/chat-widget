# Build and Deploy: Agentman Chat Widget

This guide walks you through the process of versioning, tagging, building, and deploying the Agentman Chat Widgetâ€”ensuring your release is correctly published to both npm and GitHub Releases (including the WordPress plugin bundle).

## Prerequisites
- You have push access to the repository
- You have a valid NPM_TOKEN secret set in GitHub Actions
- Your local git working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)

---

## 1. Bump the Version in `package.json`
Edit the `version` field in `package.json` to the new release version (e.g., `0.17.5`). This version must match the git tag you will create.

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "@agentman/chat-widget",
  "version": "0.17.5",
  ...
}
```

---

## 2. Commit the Change
Stage and commit your changes:
```bash
git add package.json
# (also add any other files you changed)
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.17.5"
```

---

## 3. Create a Git Tag
Tag the commit with the same version, prefixed by `v`:
```bash
git tag v0.17.5
```

---

## 4. Push Commit and Tag
Push your commit(s) and the tag to GitHub:
```bash
git push
# Then push the tag
git push origin v0.17.5
```
Or, to push both at once:
```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

---

## 5. GitHub Actions: Build & Release
Once the tag is pushed, GitHub Actions will:
- Build the project
- Update WordPress plugin metadata to match the version
- Generate the WordPress plugin ZIP bundle
- Attach the ZIP to the GitHub Release for the tag
- Attempt to publish to npm (skipping if the version already exists)

---

## 6. Verify the Release
- Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Agentman-ai/chat-widget/releases)
- Download the `agentman-chat-widget-x.y.z.zip` asset for WordPress
- Check npm for the new version: `npm info @agentman/chat-widget`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tag/Version Mismatch
- If the ZIP is missing or the workflow fails, check that `package.json` version and the git tag match exactly.
- If you need to redo a release:
  1. Delete the tag locally and remotely:
     ```bash
     git tag -d v0.17.5
     git push --delete origin v0.17.5
     ```
  2. Bump `package.json` if needed, commit, re-tag, and push again.

### NPM Publish Fails (403)
- This means the version already exists on npm. Bump the version in `package.json` and repeat the steps above.

---

## Summary Checklist
- [ ] Update `package.json` version
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Tag the commit (vX.Y.Z)
- [ ] Push commit and tag
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Actions to finish
- [ ] Download assets from the release page
